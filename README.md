# AlignmentTool

To use this tool:
-----------------
1. Hit run  
2. Load the source file (the file that you will be aligning to / will be unchanged)  
3. Load the target file (the file that you will apply changes to, realign, and export)  
4. Use the zoom and pan buttons to view the data  
5. Use the "Select Option" to mark the equivalent time points on the source (top) and target (axes)  
6. Once the marks are applied, the target data should appear realigned on the bottom axes
7. If the alignment is correct, output the data
